## How to adapt this script
If you want to adapt this script to your own needs I am all for it. You will need a Riot Games API key [(you can acquire that here)](https://developer.riotgames.com/) and some knowledge how python code although not a ton.  
  
You will want to change each of the classes to search for the ID related to your players. This can be achieved by changing the string passed into the `name = "Bluesnake"` line.  
  
Once all 5 player's names have been added to their respective class, the script is finished and can be used for your purposes. Thanks for using my source code!
