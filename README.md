## Install and Config Instructions

Install Python 3.6 [here!](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0-amd64.exe)  
Clone the repository and open up `Config.txt`
Fill in each section of the config file with your desired information. The currnet one is an example of what it will loke like when you are finished.
Place your Riot Games API key [(you can acquire that here)](https://developer.riotgames.com/) in the `RGAPI-Key = YOUR-API-KEY` section.

Once you run the program, it will output the desired information into a CSV file named after the gameID you input in the config file. Thank you for using my program!
